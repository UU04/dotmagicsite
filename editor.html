          <h3>○ April Update News</h3>

          <p class="indent">During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent 
a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt. 
Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of 
New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles, 
California. The experience made her more aware of what was 
going on in the world. After returning to New York State 
with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up. 
A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just 
14. Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and 
some college credit before trying her hand at a number of 
different jobs. Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, 
and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts. After 
graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and 
the museum there.</p>

<h3>○ HIGHLIGHT: Korean Peninsula Crisis</h3>

<p class="indent">When someone asks us, “How does that work?” or 
“Why does that happen?” we tend to answer the question 
directly if we know the answer. After all, it is efficient. 
Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to 
the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with 
this is that the direct approach can have an unintended 
consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the 
question wanted for an explanation, what the asker 
received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on 
top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes 
climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why 
does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct, 
accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the 
problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in 
reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact 
with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take 
the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative 
density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than 
ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any 
hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is 
a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct 
answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not 
work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the 
intent behind the question and formulate an answer that 
focuses on understanding instead of ______.</p>
